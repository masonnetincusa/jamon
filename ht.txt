<a href="URL, like https://www.masonnet.org">Link text</a> (Takes you to a URL that is specified after href. Make sure to end it, otherwise the whole page will be a link!)

YOU NEED TO UPLOAD IMAGES TO THE WEB!
The image URLs will be: https://jamon.masonnet.org/imagename.
(Image name is the file name of the image, you can change it on GitHub.)

Add file > Upload files.

You can use images from other websites by copying the image URL from the image in the right click menu (Tap on the trackpad with two fingers at the same time).
